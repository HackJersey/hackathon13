About:

In the film “Sex, Lies, and Videotape,” the character played by Andy McDowell worries that someday “we’ll be buried in our own garbage.” And without recycling, this worry could become a reality.

Because of this worry, citizens have been recycling throughout history, beginning with the recycling of bronze coins in Roman times and continuing to plastic bottles and can today. New Jersey holds a very important place in the history of turning trash into treasure. Given New Jersey’s fondness for making laws, it’s no surprise that the first city in the United States to mandate recycling was Woodbury, New Jersey, located in Gloucester County. (http://www.all-recycling-facts.com/history-of-recycling.html)

So how has Gloucester County fared over time? And how does the county where you live rank in terms of recycling and grant money?
 
Our project, “Talking Trash,” is an interactive map that shows each county’s recycling rate from the years 2003 – 2010, along with the grant money the state paid to municipalities. Those numbers were added within the county and then divided by county population to give a “grant money per resident” picture.
 
Simply click on the county to see its average recycling percentage along with grant money received per resident.

Bottom line: that the less a county and/ or muni wastes, the more money they make. 

Presenting the data in this manner will give Jersey residents, as well as county and municipal officials, building blocks to further encourage recycling and waste reduction in the state. This visualization represents a starting point, the race begins here. In the future, we hope this data can be used to make an app where county officials can accurately measure trash by geotagging the amount on their phones, thus altering the map’s levels. We want residents to do this too every time they curbside recycle, drop off or just throw an item away, which can incentivize residents to recycle more, especially students with smartphones. Bonus points should be given during Clean Ocean Action’s Beach Sweeps to encourage volunteers after Sandy.
