Our project, “Talking Trash,” is an interactive map that shows each county’s recycling rate from the years 2003 – 2010, along with the grant money the state paid to municipalities. Those numbers were added within the county and then divided by county population to give a “grant money per resident” picture.
 
Simply click on the county to see its average recycling percentage along with grant money received per resident.

Bottom line: that the less a county and/ or muni wastes, the more money they make. </br>
