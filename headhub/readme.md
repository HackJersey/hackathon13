This project, by [Forrest Pan](https://github.com/gzpgg3x) and Jimmy Wu, was created for the inaugural [Hack Jersey](http://www.hackjersey.com/) hackathon, Jan. 26 & 27, 2013.

This Django app grabs New Jersey company data from the SEC and looks for information about the effects of Hurricane Sandy.
